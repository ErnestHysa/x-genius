# Privacy Policy for X-Genius
**Last Updated: 2024-10-27**

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to X-Genius ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our application.

## 2. Information We Collect
We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect includes:
- **Authentication Information:** When you log in using X (formerly Twitter) via Supabase, we receive your public profile information, such as your username, display name, and avatar URL. We also receive an authentication token from Supabase which is used to verify your identity when you post content.
- **API Keys:** Your OpenRouter API key is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage. It is never transmitted to our servers or stored by us. It is sent directly from your browser to the OpenRouter API for content generation.
- **Generated Content:** The content you generate using the application is held temporarily in the application's state and is sent to our Supabase Edge Function only when you choose to post it. We do not store this content after it has been posted.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to:
- Provide, operate, and maintain our services.
- Authenticate your identity to allow posting to your X account.
- Enable you to use third-party services like OpenRouter for content generation.
- Improve and personalize your experience.

## 4. Data Storage and Security
We take the security of your data seriously.
- **OpenRouter API Key:** Your API key is stored in your browser's local storage. This means it is stored on your device and is not accessible by us. For your security, we recommend using this tool on a private computer and clearing your browser data if you are on a shared machine.
- **Authentication Tokens:** Authentication is managed by Supabase. Tokens are handled securely according to industry best practices.

## 5. Third-Party Services
Our service relies on the following third-party providers:
- **Supabase:** Used for authentication with X and for hosting the serverless function that posts your content. We recommend reviewing Supabase's privacy policy.
- **OpenRouter:** Used to generate content. Your API key and prompts are sent directly to their service. We recommend reviewing OpenRouter's privacy policy.
- **X (formerly Twitter):** Your content is posted to the X platform via their API. Your use of X is subject to their own privacy policy and terms of service.

## 6. Your Rights
You have control over your information. You can log out at any time, which will clear your authentication session. You can also clear your browser's local storage to remove the stored OpenRouter API key.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
